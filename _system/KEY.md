# System Key

This file is the exhaustive agent-facing key for the installable AIAST surface.

It covers 349 managed files and is generated from the canonical managed-file inventory.

## How To Use This File

- Start here when you need to understand which files exist before editing or delegating.
- Use `CONTEXT_INDEX.md` and `LOAD_ORDER.md` for the fastest read path, then use this key when you need full coverage.
- Regenerate this file with `bootstrap/generate-system-key.sh <target-repo> --write` whenever the managed file set or file-role wording changes.
