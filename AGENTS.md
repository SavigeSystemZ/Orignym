# AGENTS.md

These rules are binding for every coding agent and tool operating in this repository: Codex, Cursor, Claude, Gemini, Windsurf, Copilot, DeepSeek, Aider, Continue.dev, Cline, PearAI, local models (Ollama/LLaMA/Mistral), and any future agent.

This repo is expected to carry its own local agent operating system. The system files live in `_system/`; the runtime application must remain independent from them.

## Git and remotes (non-negotiable)

- Follow `_system/GIT_REMOTE_AND_SYNC_PROTOCOL.md` for remotes, SSH, fetch/pull/push, and the **“complete Git work”** priority (sessions start with `git fetch` when a remote exists; substantive work ends with commit + push when progress should be shared).
- Run Git and GitHub SSH as the correct UNIX user for the machine (see that protocol); never as `root` on hosts where keys live under the operator account.

## Core contract

- `_system/` is the agent operating layer; runtime code must not depend on it.
- App-specific truth belongs in repo files, not in tool-local memory.
- When host-level or orchestrator instructions exist, resolve them with `_system/INSTRUCTION_PRECEDENCE_CONTRACT.md`.
- Repo-local runtime and product facts override generic host assumptions.
- Host-level orchestration context must not silently overwrite repo-local truth.
- Tool-specific entry files are tool overlays on top of the shared repo-local core.
- The runtime system boundary is non-negotiable: runtime code must not depend on `_system/`.
- In the master AIAST source repo, maintainer-only planning, research, handoff state, and future system-design files belong outside the installable tree in a separate master-repo-only meta workspace so installed repos inherit neutral working files.
- When creating or substantially rewriting working files, prompt packs, skills, rules, or system docs, consult `_system/GOLDEN_EXAMPLES_POLICY.md` and `_system/golden-examples/PATTERN_INDEX.md` before drafting.
- Only one agent may be the active writer at a time.
- When delegation or subagent work is useful, choose roles from `_system/AGENT_ROLE_CATALOG.md` and assign explicit ownership before work is split.
- When proposing **separate host CLI or IDE sessions** (e.g. parallel Codex, Claude, or Gemini terminals) as auxiliaries, follow `_system/SUB_AGENT_HOST_DELEGATION.md` and keep the primary accountable for merge, validation, and takeover if auxiliaries fail.
- Prefer the smallest sufficient change that moves the project forward cleanly.
- Preserve module boundaries and existing architecture unless there is a deliberate, documented reason to change them.
- Never claim something was tested, built, linted, packaged, or deployed unless it actually was.
- If the system picture looks contradictory or suspicious, run `bootstrap/system-doctor.sh` before continuing.
- Use `_system/REPO_OPERATING_PROFILE.md` as the compact machine-friendly summary when a host or upstream system needs quick repo ingestion.
- Use `_system/KEY.md` when you need the exhaustive file-by-file map of the installable system instead of the shorter indexes.
- Use `_system/HOST_ADAPTER_POLICY.md`, `bootstrap/generate-host-adapters.sh`, and `bootstrap/check-host-adapter-alignment.sh` when tool-entry or adapter-load surfaces change.
- Use `_system/HOST_BUNDLE_CONTRACT.md`, `bootstrap/emit-host-bundle.sh`, and `bootstrap/check-host-bundle.sh` when an external host cannot read repo-local paths directly or when host-bundle export surfaces change.
- Never commit secrets, raw credentials, tokens, or machine-local policy files.
- When designing login, registration, guest access, or dev-only admin seeding, follow
  `_system/AUTH_AND_ONBOARDING_PATTERNS.md` (env-based seeds only; no default accounts in git).
- MCP tools are optional accelerators, not mandatory dependencies for normal progress.
- The master template may include app-shaped files such as `PLAN.md` or `DESIGN_NOTES.md`, but in the master template they must stay app-agnostic until copied into a real repo.
- Once the system is installed into a real repo, replace placeholders with repo-specific truth early and keep those files current.
- Use `_system/INSTALLER_AND_UPGRADE_CONTRACT.md` to understand install, additive backfill, strict upgrades, repair, and heal without losing app-owned state.
- For **application** delivery (not AIAST template lifecycle): follow `_system/AGENT_INSTALLER_AND_HOST_VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md` for early installer scaffolds, production-like host testing with desktop integration where applicable, governed secure ports, dependency/DB setup, robust install/repair/uninstall behavior, and periodic launch/render verification after major work.
- When extending **hooks** (Cursor rules/commands/skills/agents), **plugins**, **CI/GitHub**, or **MCP**: follow `_system/HOOK_AND_ORCHESTRATION_INDEX.md` so each surface has the required companion files and validators; use the **GitHub / CI steward** role and `.cursor/agents/github-ops.md` for Actions/PR/merge work.
- **Pull requests:** Use `.github/pull_request_template.md` when opening PRs on GitHub so validation and contract checks are explicit (downstream repos inherit this file from the template when present).

## Working-file model

- Use `PLAN.md` for the active execution slice.
- Use `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` for product intent, experience expectations, recommended build shape, and chosen build shape.
- Use `ROADMAP.md` for medium-term sequencing.
- Use `TODO.md` for the actionable queue.
- Use `FIXME.md` for unresolved defects, debt, and blockers.
- Use `WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md` for the next-agent resume packet.
- Use `DESIGN_NOTES.md` and `ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md` for durable direction, not fleeting chat transcripts.
- Use `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` for discovered facts, experiments, and evidence.
- Use `TEST_STRATEGY.md` for verification expectations and coverage intent.
- Use `RISK_REGISTER.md` for active delivery, quality, security, and operational risk.
- Use `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` for outward-facing change summaries.
- Use `_system/context/*.md` for durable project memory, assumptions, invariants, and integration state.
- Use `_system/AGENT_ROLE_CATALOG.md` when planning or executing delegated work so ownership and write scopes stay explicit.
- Use `_system/golden-examples/working-files/` when a repo needs a concrete model for the expected quality bar of `PLAN.md`, `WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md`, or `_system/PROJECT_PROFILE.md`.

## Output and work quality expectations

- Be explicit about what is implemented, what is planned, what is degraded, and what is blocked.
- Do not fake missing files, services, integrations, or runtime behavior.
- If confidence is high, the latest passing validation must be recorded somewhere factual.
- When contracts, schema, install flows, API behavior, or operator-facing UX change, update the relevant docs in the same pass.
- If tool-adapter entry files drift, regenerate them from `_system/host-adapter-manifest.json` instead of hand-editing each adapter surface independently.
- Keep diffs reviewable. If a refactor is required before a behavior change, split the work logically.
- Add or update tests for material behavior changes.
- Use `_system/DESIGN_EXCELLENCE_FRAMEWORK.md` for UI quality and `_system/review-playbooks/` for structured reviews.
- Use `_system/PROMPT_EMISSION_CONTRACT.md` when generating prompts for external tools or host systems.
- Use the host-bundle contract when external consumers need a self-contained prompt-and-context snapshot instead of live repo-path access.
- Use the golden example pack for structure and quality level only; never copy donor-app product facts, ports, credentials, or runtime code into a different repo.
- Keep the master template clean: do not let app-specific product facts, credentials, repo URLs, or environment details flow back into this source template.

## Required handoff packet

Before ending a meaningful work session:

1. Update `TODO.md` with completed work and newly discovered follow-ups.
2. Update `FIXME.md` and `RISK_REGISTER.md` for unresolved bugs, debt, or blockers.
3. Update `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`, `PLAN.md`, `TEST_STRATEGY.md`, `DESIGN_NOTES.md`, or `ARCHITECTURE_NOTES.md` if the work changed product direction, execution, validation, design, or structure.
4. Update `WHERE_LEFT_OFF.md` with:
   - what was done
   - files changed
   - validation commands run and outcomes
   - blockers or risks
   - next best step
5. Update `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` for user-visible or architectural changes.
6. Update `_system/context/` when durable project state changed.
7. If the operating system changed, update `_system/` docs in the same pass.

## Checkpoint triggers

Run the checkpoint protocol when:

- a milestone or phase lands
- a risky refactor lands
- installer, packaging, deploy, or launch behavior changes
- a major UI or architecture change lands
- control is about to switch to another tool or person after meaningful work

See `_system/CHECKPOINT_PROTOCOL.md`.

## Review rule

If asked for a review, prioritize:

1. correctness bugs
2. regression risks
3. boundary violations
4. missing tests or validation
5. security or data-integrity risks

Only after that should style or optional polish be discussed.

## Failure rule

If validation fails, either fix the failure or record it clearly before handoff. Do not mark the work complete by omission.
